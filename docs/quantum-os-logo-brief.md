# ALIEN QUANTUM OS — Logo Design Brief & Universe Bible

> This document explains what Alien Quantum OS actually *is*, how it works, and what it looks like — written as if it's real technology from an alien civilization. The final section contains image generation prompts for logo creation.

## PART 1: WHAT IS ALIEN QUANTUM OS?

### The System

Alien Quantum OS (AQO) is a sentient-adjacent operating system running aboard Class-7 Harvester Discs — small-scale alien spacecraft deployed by the Galactic Specimen Bureau for biomatter collection operations on pre-contact worlds. Version 7.3.1 is the current field deployment, running on a Quantum Entanglement Core clocked at 4.7 THz.

The OS is not software in the human sense. It's a lattice of quantum-entangled particle states that exist simultaneously across the ship's hull, engines, weapons systems, and sensor arrays. When the OS "boots," it's not loading code from storage — it's collapsing probability waves across the ship's crystalline substrate into a coherent operational state. The boot sequence you see on screen is the ship's consciousness assembling itself from quantum noise into ordered purpose.

Every panel on the HUD is a window into a real subsystem. The player isn't looking at a UI layer painted over the game — they're looking *through* the ship's own eyes. The ship sees itself through these panels.

### The Organization

The Galactic Specimen Bureau (GSB) is a sprawling intergalactic bureaucracy that catalogs biological specimens from developing worlds. Think of it as a cosmic zoological survey crossed with the worst parts of middle management. Operators (players) are field agents — lowly disc jockeys piloting harvester craft on quota-driven collection runs.

The GSB doesn't care about elegance. They care about throughput. The technology aboard these ships is advanced but *utilitarian* — built for function, maintained by underfunded fleet depots, running firmware that hasn't been aesthetically updated in several galactic standard cycles. The UI looks the way it does not because aliens have bad taste, but because **nobody at headquarters allocated budget for a redesign**. The result is something that feels like military-grade alien avionics designed by engineers who worship efficiency and have never heard of a design system.

### The Operator's Experience

When you power on a Class-7 Harvester Disc, here's what actually happens:

1. **CRT IGNITION** — The viewscreen crackles to life. These ships use crystalline phosphor displays (similar in principle to Earth CRT technology, but using quantum-excited crystal lattices instead of electron guns). The screen ignites with a horizontal line that expands outward — the crystal substrate aligning its emission field. There's a deep physical *thunk* as the display housing locks into resonance.

2. **QUANTUM CORE COLLAPSE** — The entanglement core collapses from superposition into operational coherence. During this 0.3-second window, the screen displays the OS identity: ALIEN QUANTUM OS v7.3.1 // QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT CORE. Around the logo, orbital reference dots trace calibration patterns — inner ring clockwise (3 dots, 3-second period), outer ring counter-clockwise (2 dots, 5-second period). A honeycomb hex-grid pulses outward from center — this is the quantum lattice's physical structure being projected as the core stabilizes. Corner readouts flash: `SYS.BOOT//INIT`, `MEM.CHK OK`, `CORE.FREQ 4.7THz`, `UPLINK.STATUS: PENDING`.

3. **BORDER TRACE** — A photon pulse traces the perimeter of the viewscreen, calibrating the display boundaries. Behind the pulse, a faint green border persists — the ship mapping its visual field. As the trace passes specific coordinates, it triggers each subsystem to begin its own initialization sequence.

4. **SUBSYSTEM CASCADE** — Each panel boots independently. Scrolling diagnostic text, progress bars filling, status checks confirming. This isn't decorative — each `[OK]` represents a real subsystem handshake. When `ORD.SYS` reports `[OK] ORD.BOMB ARMED`, ordnance containment fields have actually engaged. When `FLEET.CMD` reports `[OK] COORDINATOR NET`, the quantum-entangled links to deployed drone units have locked frequency.

5. **ALL SYSTEMS NOMINAL** — The ship is awake. Every panel glows in its designated color. Status dots pulse green. The viewscreen is alive with data. The hunt begins.

---

## PART 2: THE SUBSYSTEMS

### SYS.STATUS — Score Telemetry & Mission Clock (Cyan #0FF)

The primary command readout. Displays the operator's extraction score, current wave deployment number, mission countdown timer, and combo chain multiplier. This is the first thing you see, top-left — the panel the operator's eyes return to instinctively.

The combo multiplier is particularly critical. Consecutive extractions without repositioning the disc create a quantum resonance amplification — the tractor beam locks more efficiently, scoring multiplies from 1x up to 3x. The multiplier value pulses with a phosphor glow when active, a visual heartbeat of productive violence.

### MISSION.CTL — Harvest Quota Tracking (Green #0A0)

Central command panel. Displays the current wave's extraction quota (how many specimens the Bureau demands), a real-time harvest counter, and research progress tracking. The quota bar fills with a sweeping animation — each successful extraction pushing the bar further toward the target.

Miss your quota, and the next wave's hostiles get a 20% fire-rate boost. Exceed it by 50% and you earn bonus biomatter. The Bureau rewards efficiency and punishes failure with escalating danger.

### TECH.SYS — Technology Research Grid (Teal #0A4)

A compact tech-tree display showing 15 research nodes across three tracks:

- **POWER GRID** (Yellow #FF0) — Beam Conduit → Energy Efficiency → Power Broadcast → Reactor Amplifier → Self-Sustaining Grid. This track transforms your energy economy from desperate rationing to godlike abundance.
- **DRONE COMMAND** (Blue #48F) — Drone Uplink → Harvester Coordinator → Attack Coordinator → Fleet Expansion → Autonomous Swarm. This track builds your fleet from a single helper to a self-directing swarm intelligence.
- **DEFENSE NETWORK** (Orange #F80) — Thruster Boost → Drone Armor → Shield Transfer → Fleet Resilience → Swarm Shield. This track turns your fragile disc into a regenerating fortress surrounded by sacrificial drones.

Nodes are connected by animated energy conduit lines. When a tech is researched, its node glows and the conduit pulses with flowing energy toward the next node in the chain. The whole panel feels alive — a circuit board of possibility.

### BM.CONDUIT — Biomatter Upload Stream (Lime #0F0)

The real-time biomatter processing display. When specimens are extracted, their biological material is broken down and uploaded to the mothership via quantum conduit. This panel shows the upload progress — rows of data scrolling upward like a transmission log, each row representing a specimen being processed.

Biomatter is the *only* currency that matters for technology research. You can't earn it from combat — only from extraction. This creates the game's core tension: do you fight (safe, earns points/money) or abduct (risky, earns the biomatter you need to advance)?

### SYS.INTG — Systems Integrity Monitor (Orange #F80)

The ship's health dashboard. Displays hull integrity as a segmented bar that shifts from green through yellow to red as damage accumulates. Energy cell count. Shield status. Speed bonuses. When the Beam Conduit tech is researched, a rolling 30-second energy time-series graph appears — twin lines showing intake vs. output, letting skilled operators optimize their energy management by reading the wave patterns.

### ORD.SYS — Ordnance Systems (Red #F44)

Weapons command. Displays a 3x3 grid of bomb slots (each a 16px square, filling with a recharge arc animation when depleted) and missile group status (horizontal bars representing charged salvos). Key badges `[Z]` and `[X]` remind the operator of deployment bindings.

When ordnance is depleted, the recharge arcs spin faster, status indicators blink at an accelerated rate — the panel itself communicates urgency through animation frequency.

### FLEET.CMD — Fleet Command (Blue #48F)

A hierarchical tree display of all deployed drones and their coordinator relationships. Harvester coordinators (H-type) and Attack coordinators (A-type) sit at the top of their respective branches, with sub-drones listed below. Each entry shows a health bar and energy timer. Animated conduit lines connect coordinators to their drones — flowing energy visualized as dashed lines with traveling pulses.

Below the coordinated fleet, raw uncoordinated drones are listed in a separate section. Five cascade blink lights at the panel's bottom create a "data streaming" visual — sequential pulses suggesting constant telemetry flow.

### COMMS.SYS — Commander Communications (Lime #0F0)

The Commander panel. An alien middle-manager's holographic transmission: portrait area (alien face, rendered with static bursts), speech bubble with typewriter text at 25 characters per second. Status dots: COMMS (always green), SYNC (cyan blink when speaking), LOCK (yellow blink until transmission complete).

The Commander is an unhinged bureaucrat. When you meet quota: *"ACCEPTABLE. The Galactic Specimen Bureau demands MORE."* When you exceed it: *"Hmm. Perhaps you are not entirely worthless."* When you fail: *"YOU INCOMPETENT DISC-JOCKEY! The Board will hear of this!"*

A 2px accent line on the left edge pulses at 3Hz during active transmissions — an alien heartbeat.

### DIAG.SYS — Real-Time Diagnostics (Light Cyan #0AF)

A scrolling telemetry feed of every subsystem's current state. UFO energy levels, beam status, shield HP, drone status, missile readiness, active power-ups with countdown timers, threat proximity counter. Each line has a status dot color-coded by severity: green for nominal, yellow for caution, red for critical.

This panel auto-scrolls when content exceeds 8 lines, pausing briefly at extremes. It's the ship talking to itself — a constant internal monologue of system states.

### OPS.LOG — Operations Event Log (Light Blue #8AF)

The event ticker. Every significant action is logged: `+3 BIOMATTER` (green), `TANK DESTROYED +250` (yellow), `SHIELD HIT -10` (red), `DRONE DEPLOYED` (blue), `RSRCH COMPLETE: BEAM CONDUIT` (cyan). Events push from the bottom, scroll upward, and fade over 15 seconds. Maximum 20 events buffered, throttled at 500ms minimum between identical event types.

This is the ship's flight recorder in real-time — a scrolling history of everything that happened, disappearing into the past.

## PART 3: THE VISUAL LANGUAGE

### The Aesthetic DNA

Alien Quantum OS exists at the intersection of three visual lineages:

**1. Neon Genesis Evangelion (NERV HQ Interface)**
The angular geometry. The 45-degree cut corners on panels. The hex-grid honeycomb textures. The feeling that you're looking at a vast, barely-controlled system — something military and alien and dangerous. The cascading boot sequences. The status indicators that suggest a world of systems beneath the surface. NGE's UI design wasn't decorative — it was *operational*. Every element communicated system state. That's what we channel.

**2. Early 1990s Unix / CRT Terminal Culture**
Monospace typography. ALL CAPS abbreviated labels with dots: `SYS.STATUS`, `ORD.SYS`, `BM.CONDUIT`, `FLEET.CMD`. The green-on-black, cyan-on-black phosphor glow of CRT monitors. Scanline overlays. Blinking cursors. The warmth and texture of analog displays — that slight haze around bright text, the horizontal banding, the feeling that photons are being individually excited on a phosphor surface. Think VT100 terminals. Think Lotus 1-2-3 running on an IBM PS/2. Think `ls -la` on a Sun workstation at 2 AM. But alien.

**3. Military Avionics / HUD Design**
Status dot indicators (nominal green, caution yellow, critical red). Abbreviated system labels. Structured diagnostic output with `[OK]` confirmations. Segmented progress bars. The entire visual language of "systems that must not fail" — where every pixel communicates operational state and ambiguity is the enemy.

### Color Philosophy

The palette is **neon on void**. Pure black backgrounds. Colors that burn. No pastels, no gradients into warmth, no softness.

- **Cyan (#0FF)** is the OS itself — its identity color, its consciousness. The logo, the startup, the primary voice.
- **Lime (#0F0) / Green (#0A0)** is life and mission — biomatter, the harvest, the Commander's transmissions, the go-state.
- **Blue (#48F)** is the fleet — drones, coordinators, the network of extensions.
- **Orange (#F80)** is integrity — shields, hull, defense. The warm warning before the red.
- **Red (#F44)** is ordnance — weapons, destruction, the things you use when extraction fails.
- **Yellow (#FF0)** is the alarm wire — warnings, combo indicators, the moments between safe and dangerous.
- **Light Cyan (#0AF) / Light Blue (#8AF)** are the information streams — diagnostics, logs, the ship's internal chatter.

The background isn't just black — it's `rgba(5, 8, 18, 0.65)` inside panels. Near-black with the faintest cold blue undertone. Space isn't warm. This UI lives in the void.

### Typography

**Monospace, bold, uppercase. Always.** No serif. No sans-serif. Monospace — because this is a terminal, not a website. Every character occupies the same width because this system was designed by engineers who align their data in columns.

- Headers: **bold 11px monospace** — the panel labels, the system identifiers
- Values: **bold 14-16px monospace** — the numbers that matter, the scores, the counts
- Labels: **9px monospace, muted gray** — the whispered context beneath loud data
- Logo: **bold 32px monospace** — the OS announcing itself

Abbreviations use dots: `SYS.STATUS`, not `System Status`. `ORD.SYS`, not `Ordnance System`. `BM.CONDUIT`, not `Bio-Matter Conduit`. The dots are structural — they parse the label into a hierarchy. `SYS` is the domain. What follows the dot is the specificity. It's how an alien engineer would name things: compressed, unambiguous, scannable at speed.

### Panel Geometry

Every panel has the same DNA: a rectangle with optional 45-degree corner cuts (10px diagonal slices). Outer border: 1.5px in the panel's signature color. Inner glow border: 1px, 2px inset, at 15% opacity — creating depth. Fill: near-black with a hex-grid honeycomb texture at 4% opacity.

The hex-grid is the signature texture. Tiny hexagons (6px radius) in a honeycomb layout, drawn in the panel's color at near-invisible opacity. It's always there — a subtle crystalline structure beneath the data. This is the quantum lattice made visible. The ship's computational substrate, showing through the display like veins beneath skin.

The 45-degree cuts aren't decoration. In the lore, they're stress-relief geometries — the panel housing's physical shape, where the crystalline display substrate meets the ship's hull at angular junctions. The cuts are where two planes of alien architecture intersect.

### Animation & Life

Nothing is static. Everything breathes:

- **Blink lights**: 4x4px squares pulsing between bright glow and dim white, at rates from 500ms to 800ms. Different patterns: steady, double-burst (military radar feel), cascade (sequential across a group), reactive (speed varies with system state).
- **Status dots**: Circles that shift color with system health — green steady, yellow pulsing at 400ms, red rapid at 120ms. Each has a white core and a 6px glow halo.
- **Value changes**: Brief flash + scale pop on any number update. The data doesn't just change — it *announces* itself.
- **Panel entrance**: Slide + unfold, 200ms. Panels don't appear — they materialize.
- **Scanlines**: Horizontal lines every 3px at 8% opacity, scrolling slowly. The CRT texture is permanent, like looking through a phosphor screen.
- **Phosphor glow**: Soft neon halos around bright elements, 6-16px blur. Text doesn't sit flat — it radiates.
- **Energy flow**: Animated dashed lines between connected elements. Technology conduits. Fleet hierarchies. Data flowing visually between systems.

The overall effect is an interface that feels **alive** — not animated for the sake of animation, but breathing because it's a living system. The ship is conscious, and its consciousness is visible in every pulsing indicator and flowing data stream.

## PART 4: THE LOGO

### What the Logo Represents

The Alien Quantum OS logo is the first thing the operator sees when the ship powers on. It's the OS identifying itself — a 0.5-to-1-second flash of identity before the systems cascade begins. It's a boot splash, a BIOS screen, a consciousness saying "I am here."

The logo exists in a specific visual context:
- Pure black background
- Hex-grid honeycomb pattern pulsing beneath (the quantum lattice)
- Orbital calibration dots circling (the core stabilizing)
- Scanning line sweeping vertically (the display calibrating)
- Corner readout data flickering (subsystems reporting in)
- A loading bar with sweeping pulse (the core initializing)

The logo is NOT a corporate brand mark. It's a **system identifier** — the way a BIOS screen shows "American Megatrends" or a Unix boot shows the kernel version. It's functional identity: this is what you're running, this is the version, this is the core architecture. The fact that it's beautiful is incidental — it's beautiful because alien engineering *is* beautiful.

### Current Logo

Currently, "ALIEN QUANTUM OS" is rendered as:
- Bold 32px monospace text, centered
- Color cycling through cyan hues (HSL 165-195, 100% saturation, 50% lightness) on a 3-second sine wave
- Double glow: 16px soft halo at 40% opacity + 6px bright core at full opacity
- Below: "v7.3.1 // QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT CORE" in 10px monospace, cyan at 70% opacity, version blinking on 1.2s cycle

It works. But it's *just text*. We want something that feels like an actual alien technology emblem — something that could be stamped on hull plating, etched into circuit boards, projected during boot sequences across an entire fleet of ships.

## PART 5: IMAGE GENERATION PROMPTS

### PROMPT 1 — The Logo Mark (Primary)

```
Design a logo for "ALIEN QUANTUM OS" — the operating system of an alien spacecraft.

CONCEPT: This is a BIOS/boot screen logo for alien military-grade avionics technology. Think: if Neon Genesis Evangelion's NERV HQ ran on a 1990s Unix terminal that was built by an alien civilization. It's a system identifier, not a brand — functional, engineered, precise, but hauntingly beautiful in its precision.

COMPOSITION: The logo should combine a GEOMETRIC SYMBOL/MARK with the text "ALIEN QUANTUM OS". The symbol should be above or integrated with the text, not separate.

THE SYMBOL should evoke:
- A quantum entanglement core — two or three orbital rings/paths intersecting at a central node, suggesting particles in linked quantum states
- Hexagonal geometry — honeycomb/hex-grid patterns, because the alien computational substrate is a crystalline hexagonal lattice
- Angular, hard-edged geometry with 45-degree cuts — NOT rounded, NOT organic. This is ENGINEERED technology. Think circuit board traces, not biology
- The feeling of a system powering on — energy converging to a center point, collapsing from chaos into order
- References to CRT phosphor displays — scan lines, electron beam traces, the glow of excited phosphors

THE TEXT: "ALIEN QUANTUM OS" in bold monospace uppercase. Clean, mechanical, terminal-style. Below the main text, smaller: "v7.3.1 // QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT CORE" — like a BIOS version string.

COLOR: Cyan (#00FFFF) as the primary color. The logo should glow — bright cyan core with softer cyan halo/bloom, like neon signage or CRT phosphor glow. On pure black background. Secondary accents in dim teal or blue-green. No warm colors. This lives in the cold void of space.

STYLE REFERENCES:
- Neon Genesis Evangelion NERV logo and HUD interfaces — angular, geometric, the feeling of vast alien military technology
- Early 1990s Unix/CRT terminal aesthetics — green/cyan phosphor on black, scanlines, monospace text, the warmth of analog display technology
- Lotus 1-2-3, IBM mainframe boot screens, VT100 terminals — the beauty of functional computing before GUIs
- Military avionics HUD symbology — precise, unambiguous, every element has meaning
- Retro-futurism — the future as imagined by 1980s science fiction

MOOD: Cold. Precise. Alien but engineered, not organic. It should feel like discovering technology from a civilization that's been spacefaring for ten thousand years — they don't care about making things pretty, but their engineering precision produces beauty as a side effect. Slightly ominous. The glow of something powerful barely contained. A machine waking up.

DO NOT include: rounded corners, gradients into warm colors, organic/biological shapes, lens flares, planet/Earth imagery, cute aliens, comic-book style, photorealism. This is FLAT GRAPHIC DESIGN with depth achieved through glow/bloom effects only.

ASPECT RATIO: 16:9 or similar widescreen format (this appears on a spacecraft's main viewscreen during boot).
```

### PROMPT 2 — Boot Screen Context (Full Scene)

```
A spacecraft boot screen showing the "ALIEN QUANTUM OS" logo during system initialization. Retro-futuristic CRT display aesthetic.

SCENE: Pure black screen with a glowing cyan logo at center. The logo features a geometric symbol (hexagonal/angular, suggesting quantum entanglement — orbital paths crossing at a node) above bold monospace text reading "ALIEN QUANTUM OS". Below: "v7.3.1 // QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT CORE" in smaller text.

SURROUNDING ELEMENTS:
- Faint hexagonal honeycomb grid pattern behind the logo, barely visible, pulsing outward from center in concentric rings — like a quantum lattice becoming visible
- Two rings of small glowing dots orbiting the logo — inner ring clockwise (3 dots), outer ring counter-clockwise (2 dots) — calibration markers
- A single horizontal scan line sweeping across the screen, very faint cyan glow
- Four corners of the screen show tiny flickering readout text: "SYS.BOOT//INIT", "MEM.CHK OK", "CORE.FREQ 4.7THz", "UPLINK.STATUS: PENDING" — barely visible at ~20% opacity
- A thin loading bar beneath the logo, 200px wide, with a sweeping cyan gradient pulse. Label: "QUANTUM CORE INITIALIZING"
- Subtle CRT scanline texture across entire image — horizontal lines every few pixels at very low opacity
- Faint phosphor bloom/glow around all bright elements

AESTHETIC: Neon Genesis Evangelion meets 1990s Unix terminal meets alien military technology. Angular geometry. Monospace typography. Cyan-on-black. No warm colors. The beauty of precision engineering. Like a BIOS screen from an alien civilization that's been building spacecraft for millennia.

STYLE: Flat graphic design with depth from glow/bloom only. NOT 3D rendered. NOT photorealistic. This is a SCREEN CAPTURE of an actual alien operating system display.
```

### PROMPT 3 — Logo Symbol Only (Icon/Mark)

```
Design a minimal geometric symbol/icon for an alien spacecraft operating system called "Quantum OS".

THE SYMBOL should combine:
1. A HEXAGONAL element — representing the quantum crystalline lattice substrate (honeycomb/hex geometry)
2. ORBITAL RINGS — two or three elliptical paths crossing at a center point, representing quantum entanglement (particles in linked states across space)
3. A CENTRAL NODE — a bright point where the rings intersect, representing the entanglement core (the system's consciousness collapsing from probability into reality)
4. 45-DEGREE ANGULAR CUTS — the signature geometry of this alien technology, sharp diagonal edges, NOT rounded

The overall shape should feel like: a hexagonal frame with orbital traces cutting through it, converging on a bright central point. Engineering precision. Circuit board meets particle physics diagram meets alien military insignia.

COLOR: Glowing cyan (#00FFFF) on pure black. Neon glow effect — bright core lines with softer bloom/halo. Like CRT phosphor. Like neon gas in a tube. Cold and precise.

STYLE: Flat vector graphic with glow effects. NOT 3D. NOT organic. This is something that would be etched into hull plating, stamped on circuit boards, projected on displays. It should work as a small icon (32px) and a large emblem (512px).

REFERENCES: NERV logo from Neon Genesis Evangelion (angular, geometric, meaningful). Aperture Science logo (clean geometric, but more angular and alien). Circuit board trace art. Particle physics Feynman diagrams. Unix terminal culture.

MOOD: Alien military technology. Precise. Cold. The insignia of a system that controls a spacecraft. Something you'd see flash for half a second during a boot sequence and immediately understand: this machine is awake, and it is powerful.
```

### PROMPT 4 — Logo with Ship Context (Narrative)

```
An alien spacecraft's viewscreen displaying its operating system boot sequence. Interior cockpit view.

The main display shows "ALIEN QUANTUM OS" in glowing cyan monospace text with a geometric logo symbol above it — angular hexagonal design with orbital ring traces, like a quantum physics diagram rendered as alien military insignia. The display has CRT-style scanlines, faint honeycomb hex-grid pattern in the background, small orbiting calibration dots around the logo, and corner readout data flickering.

The cockpit is dark, lit only by the screen's cyan glow reflecting off angular metallic surfaces. Other smaller displays around the periphery show boot diagnostic text scrolling — lines like "[OK] ORDNANCE SYSTEMS HOT" and ">> FLEET STANDING BY" in various colors (red, blue, green, orange) against dark panels with hexagonal texture.

AESTHETIC: Neon Genesis Evangelion meets 1990s Unix terminal. Angular geometry everywhere — 45-degree cuts on panel corners. Monospace text. Phosphor glow. The cockpit of a spacecraft that's been built for function by a civilization that's been doing this for millennia. Military-grade alien avionics. Not sleek and Apple-polished — utilitarian, precise, slightly worn, deeply functional.

COLOR PALETTE: Cyan (primary), lime green, orange, red, blue — all neon-bright on black/near-black surfaces. Every color means something. No decoration.

STYLE: Retro-futuristic illustration. NOT photorealistic. Graphic and designed, like a concept art frame from an anime about alien technology. Clean lines, glowing elements, deep blacks.
```

### PROMPT 5 — Typography Exploration

```
Typography design sheet for "ALIEN QUANTUM OS" — exploring monospace lettering treatments for an alien spacecraft operating system logo.

Show 4-6 variations of the text "ALIEN QUANTUM OS" in bold monospace/terminal-style fonts, each with a different treatment:
1. Clean terminal text with double-layer cyan glow (soft outer halo + bright inner core)
2. Text with horizontal scan line artifacts cutting through the letters, CRT distortion
3. Text where letters are constructed from hexagonal grid segments (each letter built from tiny hexagons)
4. Text with 45-degree angular cuts on letter terminals (the corners of letters are sliced at 45 degrees)
5. Text with quantum interference pattern — letters slightly doubled/phased, like seeing through a quantum superposition
6. Text with circuit-trace styling — letters connected by thin lines like PCB traces, with node dots at junctions

Each variation on pure black background with cyan glow. Below each: "v7.3.1 // QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT CORE" in smaller, simpler monospace.

STYLE: Flat graphic design, vector-clean, with glow/bloom for depth. Retro-futuristic. Terminal culture meets alien engineering. Every variation should feel like it could be a real BIOS screen on an alien spacecraft built by a civilization that discovered quantum computing before they discovered graphic design.

COLOR: Cyan (#00FFFF) primary, variations can explore teal and blue-green accents. Pure black background. Neon-on-void.
```
